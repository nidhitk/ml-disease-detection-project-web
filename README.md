# Image Classifier with Flask and PyTorch

This project is an image classification web application built using Flask and PyTorch. It utilizes a custom-trained ResNet50 model for predicting the class of uploaded images. The web interface allows users to upload an image and receive the predicted class index from the model.

## Features

- Upload an image and get the predicted class index.
- Built with Flask as the backend and PyTorch for the model inference.
- Simple and intuitive web interface for easy usage.
- Model is based on ResNet50 with custom modifications for 13 classes.
